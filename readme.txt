Altocumulus places clouds of related tags on your Archive pages.

== Description ==

A big cloud of all your blog's tags is cool and all, but I thought it might be 
fun to try to integrate tags into the whole navigation scheme.  Altocumulus
will place a cloud of related tags at the top of your Category and Tag pages.  

If people are interested and I have the time I'll try adding more 
functionality.  Thanks for trying it out.

You can see a sample [on the internet](http://www.unsoughtinput.com/index.php/tag/the-internet/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `tag-altocumulus.php` to the `/wp-content/altocumulus/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's all there is to it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't think working on my blog / in my theme? =

I don't know - this is brand new.  Drop me a line and maybe we can figure it
out.  [My home page](http://www.jasonmorrison.net/).
